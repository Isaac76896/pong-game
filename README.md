# Mad Pong (Pygame)

This is my first game created using **pygame**.

I chose to build a classic Pong game, but with a twist as a way to fully understand the basics of pygame and to strengthen my Python programming skills.  
Through this project, I learned about game loops, player input, collision detection, and scoring systems.

Feel free to try the game and share any feedback🙂

## Controls
- Player 1: W / S / A / D
- Player 2: Arrow keys
